The version of Parcel Bundler that I'm using to package this project has problems when a dependency has a babel config. They haven't resolved these problems yet, so I'm vendoring some of those NPM libs here. 

When https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/13 closes there shouldn't be the need to do this anymore.
